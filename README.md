Is your project bloated and running slowly?

Thanos thinks it is.

Make more space and resources available to help your project run smoothly by deleting half of your files.

Simply place the 'Thanos.py' file in the root directory of you project and run it with a terminal

Thanos will work his magic and put your project in balance.

There is always a possibility that Thanos will fail though, so a random number generator will decide if your files really need deleting.

I tried to use Thanos quotes for the story, but I dont feel like I did a good job. So feel free to make your own branch to edit the story. I may merge them to the main branch if I like what you do.
